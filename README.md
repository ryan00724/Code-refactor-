## Introduction

The provided HTML code represents a website for Horiseon, but it can benefit from using semantic HTML elements to improve its structure and readability. This README provides information on how to convert the existing code to semantic HTML.

## Semantic HTML Elements

Semantic HTML elements add meaning to the structure of a web page, making it more understandable for both developers and browsers. Here are some suggested changes:

- Replace `<div class="header">` with `<header>`
- Replace `<div class="hero">` with `<section>`
- Replace `<div class="content">` with `<main>`
- Replace `<div class="benefits">` with `<aside>`
- Replace `<div class="benefit-lead">`, `<div class="benefit-brand">`, and `<div class="benefit-cost">` with `<article>` elements
- Replace `<div class="footer">` with `<footer>`

Make sure to use appropriate heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for better accessibility.
